If the impact is huge, the L1 team configures IVRs with the master ticket details so that the customers are informed about the failure(when they call the customer care numbers). Users need to refer only to the master ticket to get the most recent updates, workarounds, resolutions etc about the incident.\\nThe process of creating the master ticket, configuring IVR etc is most often manual and hence, by the time L1 sets up the IVR, there would be multiple tickets in the system.\\nIdea\\n The idea is to automate the creation of the master ticket and its linking it to the IVR by Robotic Process Automation, thereby reducing customer dissatisfaction, minimizing the L1 effort etc. This idea is more suited for failures where impact is huge and the resolution is time critical.\\nSteps for implementation\\n1. Through RPA, various business service applications/functions are polled regularly for service availability.\\n 2. If a service isnt available, tickets with the appropriate priority level is created by the incident management system, using their corresponding incident triggering mechanism\\n 3. The auto generated tickets are routed from the L1 to the corresponding L2/L3 support (this can be automated/supervised based on client requirements).\\n 4. If the estimated impact is huge, the incident management software will then trigger a search for a matching IVR template,(if not L1 has to create a new one) from the IVR template repository.\\n 5. Once the IVR is setup by the L1, any new customer wanting to raise a ticket for the same incident will be informed about the failure and will be provided with the reference to master ticket.\\n 6. If Customers, wish to get a push notification about the workaround or resolution, the IVR can accept the needed contact info, which will be updated to the intimation list associated with the ticket.\\n 7.

Ambiguity of products/ services offered.]Idea is Even if we can spend a 5 time at the time of service offered will be a great gain compared to the time spent on resolving an issue later on.]\\n4.

Implementing IT4IT Reference Architecture (Open Group), refers to all the capabilities you need to manage IT services throughout its entire lifecycle. Just like the business uses IT to support or automate its business processes, the IT organization has to use IT to support and automate IT management processes. This includes information systems such as a Project Portfolio Management (PPM) system, development and testing tools, a Configuration Management Database (CMDB), or an IT Service Management (ITSM) system for managing incidents, problems, and changes. All these IT management tools represent “IT for the IT organization”, therefore referred to as IT4IT. The IT organization is becoming more dependent upon these information systems to automate IT management activities such as build, test, deploy, monitor, and perform automated recovery. Due to the growing importance of IT management to demonstrate the value of IT, but also due to its increase in complexity, there is need to acquire new skills and competences within the IT organization to deliver these integrated IT4IT solutions.\\n\\nDespite the availability of many best practices, frameworks, and standards for managing IT, enterprises often suffer from poor services and high costs and risks due to a silo’ed IT function with badly integrated IT management tools. The Open Group IT4IT Reference Architecture standard with its value chain-based IT operating model address this problem by providing a prescriptive and detailed information model-based framework that enhances and supports traditional process-based frameworks and standards. The IT4IT Reference Architecture was created because there is a need for a holistic, concise, and structured standard of how IT should be managed to provide maximum value for the business (managing IT as a business) based upon the IT Value Chain.\\n\\nThe IT4IT Reference Architecture enables a more streamlined, transparent, and automated IT function across the entire IT value chain.\\n\\n',\n",

There needs to be a scanner through which the user can just walk-by. It scans the tag in laptop and the access tag of the user and uses face recognition to verify the identity of the person. So the person has to just walk-in and walk-out while it automatically checks-in and checks-out the laptop. \\nThe idea is to basically avoid security personnel stopping associates for various checks like, laptop, bag, id tag etc. All those checks can be much more effective if performed digitally.
